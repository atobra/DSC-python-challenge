This program calculates the hours spent by Barbara teaching and the amount of money
she makes teaching

The program has five functions
1. welcome: Displays the welcome page and the list of activities to select from
2. write: This writes our generated data to a csv file
3. read: This function accesses our stored data in the csv file
4. money_made: This calculates the amount of money made using number of hours spent
5. main: This is where all the action happens. It controls the entire program

A csv file called 'data.csv' is created when we begin a lesson for the very first time
The the date and time a lesson begins and ends are stored in the csv file using
the write function. The number of hours a lesson lasted and the money of money made are
also stored in the csv file. The csv file is stored in directory where the python file 
is stored.
